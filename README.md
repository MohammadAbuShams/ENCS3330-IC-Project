# ENCS3330 Final Project: Efficient 4x4 Enhanced Pipeline Multiplier

This project involves the design of an efficient 4x4 enhanced pipeline multiplier, optimized for speed, area, and power.

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Digital Signal Processing course under the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Birzeit University. Teams of three students collaborate to design and implement a circuit from specifications to a fully functioning system.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to design an efficient 4x4 enhanced pipeline multiplier that utilizes various power optimization techniques to improve performance. The project spans from initial design concepts to schematic implementation and simulation.


### Implementation

- **Schematic Design**
- **LTSpice Simulation**: Simulation of one cell and for the full 4 bits.
- **Layout Design**: Focus on minimizing area and optimizing power and speed.
- **Layout-based Simulation**: Validate the layout with respect to the schematic.
